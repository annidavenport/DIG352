            <p>I am a freelance web developer specialising in hospitality and creative small business.</p>
            <p>Having worked extensively in the hospitality field for over 12 years, I realised there was a real need for understanding when it came to the IT needs of small business in that industry. Many larger IT companies have set services that provide more than you need, which can be difficult for a small business to work with or afford. Small business needs creative solutions designed specifically to be as unique as the business itself, thus Little Tin Rocket was born.</p>
            <p>With broad experience in fields such as hospitality, audio engineering and multimedia, I found my way to the web arena and trained under the watchful eye of John Toyne, founder of JNR Design Studios. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Technology at RMIT University in Melbourne, and believe it is imperative to constantly review my skills and techniques to provide the best product for my clients. </p>
            <p>I love the web, and the people who make it great. Little Tin Rocket is a collaborative effort of digital demon designers, multimedia wizards and ninja developers. So many possibilities! </p>
            <p>I do code. As a front-end UI developer, I like to take a holistic approach to development starting with standards compliant code and clean, functional design, then refining the experience using a well researched understanding of user experience issues. I believe that a well executed project should generate interest, as well as displaying content.</p>
